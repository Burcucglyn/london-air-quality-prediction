CO,Carbon Monoxide,"Carbon Monoxide is a colourless, odourless poisonous gas produced by incomplete, or inefficient, combustion of fuel including 'cold' or badly tuned engines.","The gas affects the transport of oxygen around the body by the blood. At very high levels, this can lead to a significant reduction in the supply of oxygen to the heart, particularly in people suffering from heart disease.",http://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/guide/WhatIsCO.aspx
NO2,Nitrogen Dioxide,Nitrogen oxides are formed during high temperature combustion processes from the oxidation of nitrogen in the air or fuel.,"Nitrogen Dioxide has several health impacts and includes general irritation to the eyes, irritation of the respiratory system and shortness of breath.",http://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/guide/WhatIsNO2.aspx
O3,Ozone,"Ozone is not directly emitted, but is formed by a complex set of reactions involving nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons in the presence of sunlight.","Like nitrogen dioxide, high levels of ozone can irritate and inflame the lungs. It can also cause eye irritation, migraine and coughing.",http://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/guide/WhatIsO3.aspx
PM10,PM10 Particulate,"Larger particles in the atmosphere are generally filtered in the nose and throat and do not cause problems, but particulate matter smaller than about 10 micrometers, referred to as PM10, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems.","The effects of inhaling particulate matter have been widely studied in humans and animals and include asthma, respiratory problems and cardiovascular issues.",http://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/guide/WhatIsPM.aspx
PM25,PM2.5 Particulate,"These are particles which are less than 2.5 micrometers (a thousandth of a millimetre) in diameter. Particles are made up of many different chemicals, including toxic metals and organic compounds, some of which are highly chemically reactive and researchers consider these to be involved in the toxicological effects of particles.",They are thought to have a greater effect on health than larger particles as they can be carried deeper into the lungs where they can cause inflammation and worsen heart and lung diseases.,http://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/guide/WhatIsPM.aspx
SO2,Sulphur Dioxide,Sulphur Dioxide is produced when a material or fuel containing sulphur is burned. Pollution episodes only generally occur where there is widespread domestic use of coal or in the vicinity of coal or oil-fired power stations.,"Short-term exposure to high levels of sulphur dioxide may cause coughing, tightening of the chest and irritation of the lungs.",http://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/guide/WhatIsSO2.aspx
