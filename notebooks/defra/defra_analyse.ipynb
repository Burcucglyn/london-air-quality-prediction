    "## 1) Initial Dataset Assessment: Raw Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Before conducting quality checks, I need to establish the baseline characteristics of the DEFRA dataset. This section calculates comprehensive statistics about the data collection effort, including file counts, measurement records, station coverage, and pollutant distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "- Document the scale and scope of data collection.\n",
    "- Establish baseline metrics for comparison with LAQN.\n",
    "- Provide context for subsequent quality analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "The function `get_defra_dataset_statistics()` performs the following:\n",
    "1. Loads standardised metadata to identify unique stations and pollutants.\n",
    "2. Counts files across all three yearly directories (2023, 2024, 2025).\n",
    "3. Calculates total measurement records by reading all CSV files.\n",
    "4. Determines spatial coverage from unique coordinate pairs.\n",
    "5. Documents temporal coverage (35 months: January 2023 to November 2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- File counting is fast (scans directory structure only).\n",
    "- Record counting can be slow (reads every CSV file).\n",
    "- Results are saved to JSON for reproducibility."
