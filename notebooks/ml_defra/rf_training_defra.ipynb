    "# Random Forest Modelling Notebook for DEFRA\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook for Random Forest training using 2D flattened data.\n",
    "- Inputs will be taken from: `data/defra/ml_prep` folder.\n",
    "- Following the same structure as LAQN RF training for direct comparison.\n",
    "- Using Géron's *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow* 3rd edition.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What this notebook does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load prepared data from ml_prep output.\n",
    "2. Understand the X and y structure (following Géron Chapter 2).\n",
    "3. Train a baseline Random Forest model.\n",
    "4. Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, R² (Géron Chapter 2 evaluation approach).\n",
    "5. Fine-tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV (Géron Chapter 2).\n",
    "6. Analyse feature importance.\n",
    "7. Save the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Random Forest?\n",
    "\n",
    "From Géron (2023, Chapter 7), Random Forest is an ensemble of Decision Trees trained on different random subsets of the training data. Each tree votes on the prediction, and the final output is the average (for regression) or majority vote (for classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key advantages for air quality prediction:\n",
    "- Handles nonlinear relationships without feature scaling.\n",
    "- Provides feature importance for interpretability.\n",
    "- Robust against overfitting when properly tuned.\n",
    "- Works well with tabular data like our flattened time series.\n",
