    "# Random Forest Modelling Notebook for DEFRA - All Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains Random Forest models for all site_pollutant combinations in the DEFRA network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** `data/defra/ml_prep_all` folder  \n",
    "**Output:** `data/defra/rf_model_all` folder  \n",
    "**Reference:** Geron's *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow* 3rd edition, heavy usage of scikit-learn documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load prepared data from ml_prep_all output.\n",
    "2. Identify all pollution targets (40 site_pollutant combinations).\n",
    "3. Tune hyperparameters per pollutant type (6 tuning runs).\n",
    "4. Train a Random Forest model for each target with progress tracking.\n",
    "5. Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, r2 for all models.\n",
    "6. Analyse results by pollutant type.\n",
    "7. Save all trained models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why DEFRA?\n",
    "\n",
    "DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) operates the Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN), the UK's statutory national air quality monitoring network. While LAQN focuses specifically on London with dense coverage, DEFRA provides nationally standardised measurements with rigorous quality assurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key DEFRA characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher data completeness:** 91.2% vs LAQN's 87.1%.\n",
    "- **Fewer but higher-quality stations:** 40 site-pollutant combinations vs LAQN's 141.\n",
    "- **Standardised methodology:** National monitoring protocols ensure consistency.\n",
    "- **Direct comparison:** Enables testing whether data quality beats data quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using GridSearchCV or MultiOutputRegressor which trains all 40 targets simultaneously, I train each site_pollutant combination separately. This allows progress tracking, individual model evaluation, and saving intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Targets:** 6 pollutants across 40 site_pollutant combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NO2: 13 sites.\n",
    "- O3: 8 sites.\n",
    "- PM10: 7 sites.\n",
    "- PM25: 7 sites.\n",
    "- SO2: 3 sites.\n",
    "- CO: 2 sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why only 6 pollutants?\n",
    "\n",
    "DEFRA's AURN network in the Greater London area monitors these six regulatory pollutants, matching the same pollutants available in LAQN. This enables direct comparison between the two networks using identical pollutant types, testing whether DEFRA's higher data quality compensates for its smaller station count.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike LAQN which required multiple failed attempts, DEFRA training benefited from lessons learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LAQN challenges (solved before DEFRA):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- GridSearchCV memory crashes on my local laptop.\n",
    "- MultiOutputRegressor still too memory-intensive.\n",
    "- Required HalvingGridSearchCV and checkpoint saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DEFRA approach (applied directly):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used HalvingGridSearchCV from the start.\n",
    "- Tuned one representative site per pollutant (6 tuning runs).\n",
    "- Applied optimal params to all sites of that pollutant type.\n",
    "- Checkpoint saving every 10 models for safety.\n",
    "- Memory-safe parameters (max_depth capped at 15, n_estimators at 100).\n",
    "- To save some time, I ran this notebook on Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training times:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuning: approximately 13 minutes (vs LAQN's longer tuning due to more features).\n",
    "- Full training: Significantly faster due to fewer features (528 vs 1,740).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single-station baseline results\n",

    "| Test RMSE | 0.050 | 0.033 | DEFRA |\n",
    "| Test MAE | 0.034 | 0.023 | DEFRA |\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that data quality beats data quantity. DEFRA achieved 34% lower RMSE with 39% fewer features. The all stations training tests whether this advantage holds across all pollutant types."
